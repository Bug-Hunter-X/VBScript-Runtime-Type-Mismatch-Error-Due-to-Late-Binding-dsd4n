# VBScript Runtime Type Mismatch Error
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in VBScript caused by its late binding behavior.  Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to unexpected type mismatch errors if variable types are not carefully managed.

The `bug.vbs` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with explicit type declarations to avoid the error.  This example highlights the importance of understanding and managing data types in VBScript to prevent runtime issues.
