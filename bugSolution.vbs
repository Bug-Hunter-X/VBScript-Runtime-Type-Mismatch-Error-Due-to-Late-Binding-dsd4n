Explicit Type Declarations and Early Binding:
The most effective way to prevent type mismatch errors is to declare variable types explicitly using the `Dim` statement with a type specifier (e.g., `Dim myVar As Integer`, `Dim myStr As String`).  Alternatively, you can use `Option Explicit` at the beginning of your script to enforce variable declarations.  This enables early binding, checking variable types during compilation rather than runtime.

Corrected Example:
```vbscript
Option Explicit
Dim strVar As String
Dim numVar As Integer
strVar = "10"
numVar = CInt(strVar) ' Convert String to Integer
result = numVar + 5 ' No error
```

By explicitly declaring the variable types and converting the string to an integer, we avoid the runtime type mismatch error.
